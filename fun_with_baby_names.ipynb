    "# Calculating the uniqueness and average age of my children\n",
    "This is just a playful analysis of my kids' names using data from the Social Security Administration (SSA). In particular, I was curious about the fact that before my daughter, I only ever knew of two women named Maya: Angelou and Rudolph. We named our daughter after the former, believing it to be a beautiful and seemingly unique name, and Maya Angelou was a great poet and activist who had died shortly before our daughter's birth. (Side note: it also allowed me to tie in my love for astronomy: the \"oldest sister\" in the Pleiades star cluster is named Maia). However, when we moved to California a few of years ago, we started meeting several girls between the ages of 2 to 12 named Maya. Is the name more popular than we realized? Or is this a case of frequency illusion? With regards to our son, Henry, we assumed that the average age of Henry's has to be around 80, but again, we seem to be meeting more and more kids named Henry. So what is the average age of Henrys? Let's see what we can find out.\n",

    "Regarding the name Maya, the first thing that stands out is that it doesn't appear in the SSA data until around 1940. The name is found in lots of cultures, so I'm curious if the introduction of the name into the US was the result of post-World War II migration.  Unfortunately, that will remain speculation with this current data set, but maybe something to look into in the future.  There has definitely been a steady increase in girls named Maya since the mid-1980s, with a peak just before my daughter was born. This peak, however, is nothing compared to the numbers we are getting from the name Henry. It seems like Henry is making a very strong comeback and nearing its peak in the early 20th century.  Looks like we are going to have a lot of Henrys over the age of 75 and under the age of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far it seems like Maya is a relatively unique name.  To get a better idea of how unique, let's plot Maya against the top 5 most popular girl's name for 2014. I will create dataframes for each of the top 5 names so that we can pull the birth count numbers over time. Then we can plot the data compared to the name Maya.  Interestingly enough, if you plot all of the birth counts of these names over the years, you will see that they were all relatively unpopular until the mid-80's and 90's when they all began to climb rapidly. For this reason, I started the data off at 1980 so that we can get a better look."

    "It appears that I was wrong on both accounts: there are not an inordinate number of Mayas being born and the average age of Henry is not even close to 80. The name Maya only accounted for 0.22% of females born in 2014. However, the name has unarguably gained popularity in the last 30 years. The average age of Henry is only 37, but the guess of 80 was not completely off-base. The peak year for Henrys was 1921, which means there are plenty of Henrys born 80 or more years ago.\n",
