# babynames
In an attempt to start blogging about my journey toward becoming a data scientist, I am beginning by analyzing the Social Security Administration's baby names dataset and actuarial life tables. Rather than just looking at popular baby names, I decided to ask a couple of questions:

1. Is my daughter's name as uniques as I thought it was?
2. Does my son have the name of an 80-year-old man?
